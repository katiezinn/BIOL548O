```

Organization
  /R <- main analysis fie, does the analysis, makes the figures (a well-commented file)
    <- R files with functions
    <- data cleaning scripts
      saveRDS() #only can be read by r
      readRDS()
Local paths only "datasets/sex_chrom" write out the output. df as csv, other as .rds

Keep workspace clean
-restart R occassionally
-only import Fxn s e data you need
use tidyr::spread() -- if you don't need the whole package only use what you need 

Name variables and functions intelligibly

```{r}
source("tidyjoins.R")
#pulls the airports and flights functions we ran last class, puts them all in the environment 
```

Rule(ish)
- if you are going to do something more than twice, write a function
